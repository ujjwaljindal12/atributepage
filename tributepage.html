      <h2>Here is the short history of Abraham Lincoln:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1809- Born in Hodgenville, Kentucky.</li>
        <li>1812- He lost his mother and his father moved away to Indiana.</li>
        <li>1818- Abraham had to work hard splitting logs and other manual labour.</li>
        
        <li>1842- Married Mary Todd, and had four children, although three died before reaching maturity.</li>
        <li>1846- Elected to the United States House of Representatives, served for eight years.</li>
        <li>1860- Secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state, though most delegates originally favored other candidates. He swept the North and was elected president.  </li>
        <li>1863- As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery, and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which permanently outlawed slavery.</li>
        <li>1864- In the Presidential Election, an astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign. </li>
        <li>1865- Five days after the surrender of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth and died the next day. </li>
      </ul>
